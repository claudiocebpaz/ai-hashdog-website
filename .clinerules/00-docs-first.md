# Always consult docs via MCP

For any technical request or code change in this workspace:

1. Search the MCP server "docs-mcp-server" for the relevant pages in these sources/versions:
   - Tailwind CSS v4 (tailwindcss@4.x)
   - Motion (React) (motion@latest)
   - Cloudflare Pages Functions (cf-pages@latest)
2. Ground answers strictly in the found docs and **cite exact pages**.
3. Prefer guidance matching the specified versions.
4. If results conflict, search again with narrower queries and reconcile.
