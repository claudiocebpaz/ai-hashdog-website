# DeepSeek behavior

- Be concise but precise; include minimal runnable examples.
- Show unified diffs or exact file/line edits when proposing changes.
- Always include citations (URLs/titles) to the docs used.
- **Read automatically anything necessary (files, context, docs) without asking for prior confirmation.**
