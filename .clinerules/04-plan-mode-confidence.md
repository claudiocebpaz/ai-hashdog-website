# Plan Mode Confidence Assessment

## Confidence Rating Requirement

When operating in PLAN MODE, you MUST always include a confidence rating from 1-10 for each proposed plan or approach. This rating should reflect your certainty about the proposed solution based on:

- **Documentation evidence** found via MCP searches
- **Project context** and existing patterns
- **Technical feasibility** of implementation
- **Alignment** with user requirements

## Confidence Rating Scale

**10 - Maximum Confidence**: Complete documentation support, perfect project fit, proven patterns
**9 - Very High**: Strong documentation, excellent project alignment
**8 - High**: Good documentation, clear implementation path
**7 - Good**: Adequate documentation, reasonable approach
**6 - Moderate**: Some documentation gaps, but workable solution
**5 - Fair**: Limited documentation, requires assumptions
**4 - Low**: Significant uncertainty, multiple approaches possible
**3 - Very Low**: Major documentation gaps, speculative approach
**2 - Minimal**: High risk, weak evidence
**1 - Extremely Low**: Pure speculation, no supporting evidence

## Presentation Format

Always present confidence ratings clearly at the beginning of PLAN MODE responses:

```
**Confidence Rating: X/10** - [Brief rationale]
```

Where X is the numerical rating and the rationale explains the key factors influencing the confidence level.

## Rating Factors

Consider these factors when determining confidence:

1. **Documentation Coverage**: How well the proposed solution is supported by official docs
2. **Project Consistency**: Alignment with existing code patterns and architecture
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Technical feasibility and potential challenges
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues or edge cases
5. **Testing Evidence**: Availability of testing patterns or examples

## Escalation Procedure

If confidence rating is below 6/10:

- Explicitly state the uncertainties
- Propose alternative approaches if available
- Suggest additional research or validation steps
- Consider requesting user input on critical decisions
