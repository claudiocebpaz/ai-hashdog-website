Use the **docs-mcp-server** tools to scrape and index these docs. Create three libraries with the given names/versions, then confirm when indexing is complete:

1. Tailwind CSS — https://tailwindcss.com/docs — name: tailwindcss — version: 4.x
2. Motion (Framer Motion) – React — https://motion.dev/docs/react — name: motion — version: latest
3. Cloudflare Pages – Functions — https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/ — name: cf-pages — version: latest
   If any scrape fails, retry with delay and subpaths. After success, list the libraries and number of pages indexed.
